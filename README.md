# Frontend Trial Work

Welcome to geOps! We have prepared some tasks so you can show us your skills in frontend development. The tasks are divided into two parts: development and debugging. Feel free to ask us any questions you may have.

## 1. Development

Depending on your experience (MapLibre, OpenLayers, React) and available time, you can choose between a simple and complex task. The simple task is designed to be completed in a 1-2 hours, while the complex task requires about a day of work.

Please let us know which tasks still need to be completed for productive environments. The finished application should be published on [GitHub](https://github.com/) in a personal Git repository.

### 1.1 Simple

Write a small [React](https://react.dev/) web application that displays a map based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) using the [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) library.

### 1.2 Complex

Write a [React](https://react.dev/) web application that displays a map based on [geOps vector tiles](https://developer.geops.io/apis/maps) using the [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) library and renders GeoJSON provided by the user, similar to the [geojson.tools](https://geojson.tools/) web app. Feel free to use other libraries you think are necessary. The application should have the following features:

- Display a map based on geOps vector tiles.
- Provide a textarea in a sidebar where the user can enter a GeoJSON string.
- Parse the GeoJSON string and display the features on the map.

## 2. Debugging

We have prepared a small `example-app` that has some bugs. Your task is to find and fix them. Try to let us take part in your thought process.
